======================================================

This paper focus on the study of contemporary mobile processors architecture

ABSTRACT

Today the computing landscape is significantly different from before: growth in tablets and smartphone is surpassing that of desktops and laptops. However, the battery technology doesnâ€™t keep up with the evolution of mobile CPU. Energy and power are now the primary design constraints. This paper studies the architecture of contemporary mobile processors based on both ARM and X86 ISA, focusing on their improvement from tradition desktop CPU and effects on power efficiency and performance.
